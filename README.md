# -My66daysofdataJourney
This is a repository containing resources and how I developed consistency in learning related to data science
Herein contains my progress as a newbie and aspiring data scientist along with reaources that aided my 5 a minute a day learning.


    So on the first day i realized i needed to have a goal short term,which would guide my study. My friend Renaeta i had met on Kaggle community gave me this insight. So on the first day i listed some goals . They include: 
1. Programming: Python and SQL
2. Mathematics and Fundamental Statistics
3. Exploratory Data Analysis using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
4. Data Visualization
5. Machine Learning
Bonus: Data Structure and Algorithm , Version Control.
  
  I sincerely felt i needed to just know enough in all of this to finally start a project on my own eventually.I got this on Tina Huang's Youtube Video on how to learn Data Science. With this in mind i set out to take each day one step at a time. Kem Jee said this wasn't about the amount of data stuff you know but about making studying data science a habit.I joined the discord server to monitor my progress and interact with a community and so far its being good.
  
## Day 1
Jan 4th 2021 
 When studying , i tend to not be able to focus on one subject for long so basically my 66days will be a mix of all my goals.
 I learnt: Introduction to SQL 
 Resource: Learn SQL in one day pdf
 Note: I will try to attach most of the resources i used or a website one could check out
